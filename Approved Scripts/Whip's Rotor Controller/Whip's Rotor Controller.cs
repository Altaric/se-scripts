Word is, the late privateering Captain Talon the Stubborn has stashed away his wealth on one of the nearby isles.

From the first isle of bountiful resources, travel 6 leagues northeast to the Rato e √Åguia Islands.
Then travel another 6 leagues west to reach the Isle of Three.
Travel 4 leagues north, and you will reach the Abysmal Reef.
The treasure lies upon the northwestern-most island of the Abysmal Reef!

The first faction to redeem this treasure, with photographic evidence, at the central base of dropoff shall be awarded 5 Organic Points!
You must immediately take the treasure to the central base when you first collect it!
Be wary: Captain Talon was quite wealthy! Your vessel must be capable of lifting his heavy stash (70 tons)!
